The procedures described in Green Book Box I.C.1.a.ii. are translated here into a data pipeline written in the R computing language so that the implementation of the procedures are transparent, reproducible, and can be expediently applied to quantify where and when the vegetation goals of the Agreement are being met, and where they are not.\nAny parcel or group of parcels exhibiting a persistent deviation from baseline vegetation goals determined by these statistical procedures is evaluated by the Technical Group to determine whether or not the apparent change would have occurred in the absence of pumping stress and/or in the absence of changes in past surface water management practices using the procedures in Green Book Section I.C.1.b., Determining Attributability."

If any of these goals are not achieved, feasible mitigation of the affected area will be implemented. However, mitigation is not considered a primary management tool, but rather a secondary tool that will be employed should impacts occur that are inconsistent with the goals of the Agreement.”\n“This section outlines a procedure for determining whether decreases and/or changes in vegetation or other significant effects on the environment have occurred or are occurring in a given management area. It describes the process the Technical Group will follow to ascertain whether a change is significant, and thus, whether it requires mitigation. It also describes how the Technical Group will develop and implement a mitigation plan and monitoring and reporting program.”\nSection I.C.1, Determination of Significant Impacts\n“A significant decrease or change or other significant effect on the environment will be mitigated if it is measurable, attributable to groundwater pumping or surface water management practices, and significant. The Agreement provides that the determination of significance of an impact, and thus, whether it must be mitigated, will be made on a case by case basis. The steps in the case by case analysis are described below.”\nSection I.C.1.a (Determining Measurability)\n“In determining whether a change in vegetation cover or composition is measurable, the Technical Group will consider all relevant factors, including:\ncomparison of current vegetation cover and composition in the affected area with similar data taken during other time periods, including the 1984-87 vegetation inventory data;\nComparison of vegetation cover and composition at the affected area with vegetation data from one or more control sites located in areas which have similar vegetation, soil, and precipitation conditions;\ncomparison of the ratio of recently deceased vegetation to live vegetation in the affected area with other areas not affected by pumping and with similar vegetation cover and composition, soil, and precipitation conditions;\nuse of air photo and remote sensing techniques to assist in making comparisons of conditions during different time periods and in mapping the affected area;\ncomparison of data from randomly selected transects with similar data taken during other time periods, including the 1984-87 vegetation inventory data. This method will be employed in areas where monitoring site data does not exist, or where data covers an insufficient time period. Such transects will be performed as described in Box I.C.1.a.ii.”\nIn determining measurability, Section I.C.1 describes, “A determination of measurability will be made if any of the relevant factors considered indicate even a small documentable change in vegetation cover or composition has occurred.”\nThe updated Green Book BOX I.C.I.a.ii. outlines a set of procedures to assess measurability based on the transect-level monitoring data’s statistical deviation from baseline."

    "text": "Green Book Box I.C.1.a.ii\nTRANSECTS FOR MONITORING VEGETATION RESPONSE TO PUMPING\nVegetation transects are included within the Green Book to serve two purposes: 1) to estimate transpiration from a monitoring site, and 2) for use in determining whether vegetation has decreased or changed significantly from the previous cover.\n\nDetailed measurements of leaf area index shall be made at each of the monitoring sites using the techniques described in Section III.C. These measurements will be used to estimate evapotranspiration from the vegetation at the monitoring site for comparison to available soil water and, ultimately, to project plant-soil water balance and the need for water table recovery. Vegetation transects shall also be used in cases of suspected vegetation changes due to groundwater pumping. However, rather than using the intensive sampling technique of Section III.D for calculating evapotranspiration, plant cover shall be measured by the line-point technique described below.\nDuring the 1984-87 inventory, most parcels were sampled with line-point transects of 100 feet in length, with sampling points at one-foot intervals, providing a two-dimensional representation of vegetation within the parcel. At each one-foot marker, the first contact with the uppermost layer of live plant cover was recorded. Cover and species composition were calculated from all sampling points along the transect.\n\nThe 1984-87 inventory shall be used as a “baseline” to determine whether vegetation cover and/or species composition has changed. This inventory is the only one of sufficient accuracy to permit comparison of species composition and cover.\nA subset of the vegetation parcels mapped during the 1984-87 baseline inventory shall be annually monitored to accommodate statistical comparison with data collected during the baseline inventory. Such monitoring may rely on repeat measurement of georeferenced locations using the line-point-intercept method to track live cover and species composition over time. The baseline inventory was summarized at the parcel scale, thus for statistical comparison, transect locations derived from a set of random locations and azimuths provide a valid statistical comparison.\nParcels to be monitored were initially selected based on meeting one or more of the following criteria: (1) parcel contained a permanent monitoring site; (2) baseline inventory data were collected for the parcel; (3) parcel was in close proximity to a pumping well; (4) information of past and current land use for parcel was available; (5) parcel was representative of one of the groundwater-dependent plant communities originally mapped during the baseline inventory; (6) soil characterization was available for the parcel; (7) characterization of the landscape position was available for the parcel. In 2015, Inyo County and Los Angeles began a joint monitoring program utilizing a combination of parcels and transects evaluated and agreed upon by the staffs of both parties. As of 2016, 1,688 transects across 141 parcels are jointly monitored by both parties.\nApproximately 100 of the 141 parcels monitored in 2016 will be jointly selected and monitored each year by Inyo County and Los Angeles. Prior to the field season, staff from both parties will determine which parcels of the 141 will be monitored. Existing permanent transects will be used for those parcels selected unless the staffs of both parties agree that a change in transect location is justified and necessary. Transects will be evenly split between ICWD and LADWP. Either party may independently conduct monitoring of additional parcels or transects; however, any data so collected shall be provided to the other party.\nThe field protocol and calibration for field observations for the joint line-point monitoring program largely follows Herrick et al.(2016). At the onset of the monitoring season, staff from both parties shall meet in the field to discuss methods and to calibrate all field personnel. In summary the field protocol is as follows:\n\nnavigate to the transect start point with a handheld GPS device;\nverify presence of an aluminum tag which has been previously attached to a nearby object (i.e. shrub, debris, etc.);\nuse a photo taken from the previous year to precisely locate the transect start point and to examine the accuracy of the azimuth used during the previous year;\nif the start point on the photo is off by more than 6 meters from the point indicated by a GPS reading, or a start point cannot be positively identified, a start point will be placed at the point indicated by the GPS device;\nif the designated transect azimuth is off by more than ±5 degrees from the azimuth depicted within the previous year’s transect photo, the designated transect azimuth will be used. If not, the azimuth depicted within the previous year’s photo will be upheld;\nstretch a tape measure to the direction of the pre-established azimuth;\nfor each transect, notes shall be taken on whether an aluminum tag is present, and whether or not the current year’s start point and compass azimuth matches those depicted within the previous year’s transect photo;\nrecord species identity at each half meter starting at 0.5 m and ending at 50 m yielding 100 possible hits;\nplace a dry erase board with the parcel name, transect number, azimuth and date at the base on the transect line and take a picture from the start point toward the end point that captures the entire transect.\n\nAll live cover is tallied for each species for each transect. Data are exchanged at the end of the field season after each party digitally enters and proofs field data.\nThe field technique and sampling design may be modified to permit detailed statistical comparison if deemed necessary in the future. Statistical analysis will be used to determine the measurability (statistical significance) of vegetation changes from the 1984-87 baseline inventory maps. Such an analysis may include, but is not limited to, Welch’s test (t-test with unequal variance), Wilcox test (Mann-Whitney test), Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Generalized Linear Model (GLM) for vegetation cover and permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance (PERMANOVA) and Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) for vegetation composition. For parcels with small baseline inventory sample sizes (e.g. 1-4 transects), a one-sample t-test may be performed using the baseline inventory sample mean as the null hypothesis for the test. Determination of measurability will be made by the Technical Group on case by case basis in accordance with Water Agreement IV.B and Green Book Section I.C.\nBox I.C.1.a.ii shall be modified as necessary in the future to incorporate new or modified field techniques, technology, and/or analytical methods. Such changes will be jointly developed by the staffs from both Inyo County and Los Angeles and will be presented to the Technical Group for consideration."

Parcels were assigned to the control group if (1) kriged DTW estimates were less than 1 m and (2) they were located at sites corresponding to modeled drawdown contours less than 10 ft. If the kriged DTW estimates were not reliable owing an inadequate test-well network near the vegetation parcel, then the groundwater-flow model estimate of the 10-ft drawdown contour was used as the sole criteria to designate parcels as either wellfield or control.\nAn exception to the above criteria was applied to parcels associated with drawdown contours greater than 10-ft yet located near a surface water source (specifically, a canal, sewer pond, creek, river, or a ground water seepage source) that would lessen local drawdown effects—these parcels were classified as control.\nSome parcels currently in the wellfield group have higher water tables than during the 1987 to 1993 period, but remain in the wellfield group because of their close proximity to pumping wells and potential for pumping-induced drawdown. Each parcel is also classified by its Green Book management type, Holland plant community type and by its status as either wellfield or control."

    "text": "3.2 Wellfield Control Group Comparison\nFor an overview of the pumping effect on GDEs in Owens Valley, parcels were classified in the early 1990s as either within a wellfield group potentially affected by pumping or a control group where the pumping effect was determined to be negligible on water table drawdown. In the 2000s, a rarefield subset of these parcels that had been sampled every year since 1992 was selected and this set has continued to be sampled each year to 2022. This particular set is small with 13 control and 31 wellfield parcels. For this rarefied subset, averages are plotted below for comparison of the groups over time and linear trends are reported for total cover, perennial herbaceous cover and woody shrub cover separately. In 2022, 41 control and 91 wellfield parcels were sampled, so this rarefield set represents only 34% of wellfield parcels and 32% of control parcels in the current year sample."

    "text": "targets data pipeline\nThe Targets R package is a data pipeline toolkit allowing dependency awareness and automatic rerunning of code that is downstream from dependency changes. A single _targets.R script was constructed linking datasets to the pipeline. The functions to process and analyze the data of this pipeline are maintained in a single file from code/R/functions.R and the _targets.R script sources these functions to make the pipeline.\nThe targets package tar_visnetwork() function output shows the data pipeline in an interactive format. Links are dependencies between functions and targets (input files, intermediate data transformations, model objects, plots and tables etc) specifying which targets are upstream from others and which are out of date and which downstream dependencies need to be rerun for the output to stay current. In the interactive viewer, functions are shown as triangles and targets are shown as circles. Fill color indicates whether or not upstream dependencies are ‘Up to date’ (green) or ‘Outdated’ (blue). Only the downstream dependencies of updated targets or functions will be re-evaluated when the pipeline is rerun using tar_make().\n\n\nShow the code\nwithr::with_dir(rprojroot::find_root('_targets.R'),tar_visnetwork())\n\n\n── Attaching packages ─────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.2 ──\n✔ ggplot2 3.4.0      ✔ purrr   0.3.5 \n✔ tibble  3.1.8      ✔ dplyr   1.0.10\n✔ tidyr   1.2.1      ✔ stringr 1.5.0 \n✔ readr   2.1.3      ✔ forcats 0.5.2 \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nhere() starts at /Users/zac/Documents/projects/open-science-notebook\nLinking to GEOS 3.11.0, GDAL 3.5.3, PROJ 9.1.0; sf_use_s2() is TRUE\nLoading required package: ggpp\n\nAttaching package: ‘ggpp’\n\nThe following object is masked from ‘package:ggplot2’:\n\n    annotate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_targets.R View functions.R\n\n\nShow the code\n# *Increasing opportunities for collaboration while promoting scientific innovation, transparency, and reproducibility* is a primary objective of NASA's Open-Source Science Initiative, TOPS (Transform to OPen Science). Within the TOPS mission, NASA is designating **2023 as the Year Of Open Science**, a community initiative to spark change and inspire open science engagement through events and activities that will accelerate adoption of open science practices. TOPS is only the starting point; **the science community needs agencies and organizations to make a long-term commitment to support building an inclusive open science community over the next decade.**\n\n\n\nThe targets R package is a Make-like pipeline toolkit for statistics and data science in R. With targets, you can maintain a reproducible workflow without repeating yourself. targets skips costly runtime for tasks that are already up to date, runs the necessary computation with implicit parallel computing, and abstracts files as R objects. A fully up-to-date targets pipeline is tangible evidence that the output aligns with the code and data, which substantiates trust in the results. targets github"

    "text": "GB Section I.C.1.b. Determining Attributability\nOnce it has been determined that there has been a measurable vegetation decrease or change, it must be determined whether the impact is attributable to groundwater pumping or to changes in surface water management practices.\nA determination of whether the impact is attributable to groundwater pumping or changes in surface water management practices will be based on evaluation and consideration of relevant factors, which may include:\nRecent and historic water table changes and response to pumping as measured at the monitoring site(s) closest to the affected area.\nComparison of soil water, depth to water, and degree of vegetation decrease or change at the affected area and at the control site(s) determined to have similar soil type and vegetation composition and cover.\nComparison of water table depths in the affected area with water table depths in the general region with soils, vegetation cover, and vegetation composition comparable to the affected site. New shallow piezometers may be installed and monitored, if necessary, to obtain relevant water table data.\nRainfall differences that may exist between the control site(s) and the affected area.\nEvaluation of the extent to which other factors unrelated to the effects of groundwater pumping may have contributed to the vegetation change or decrease. Such factors include drought, wet/dry climatic cycles, flooding, fungal blight, range management practices, wildfire, and off road vehicles.\nChange in soil water within the root zone caused by a pumping induced change in the water table.\nReview of surface water operations to determine if changes from past practices contributed to vegetation changes.\nA decrease in flow from a spring or flowing well.\nIf a decrease in flow from a spring or flowing well occurs, the Technical Group shall determine whether the decrease corresponds to changes in groundwater pumping and runoff. If, on the basis of qualitatively evaluating the data, it appears that the decreased flow corresponds with increased pumping and decreased runoff, the Technical Group shall conduct a quantitative analysis of the data, using one or both of the methods described below, or any other method developed by the Technical Group:\nThe Technical Group shall perform a regression analysis of the relevant groundwater level, spring flow, runoff/recharge, and pumping data associated with the site (an example of applying this technique is found in the Technical Group’s analysis of the water flow decrease at Reinhackel Spring).\nThe Technical Group shall use the groundwater model of the area in question as a supplement to the regression analysis, or as a substitute for the regression analysis if the data are inadequate to develop a regression model. The model would be applied by evaluating groundwater level and spring flow changes in the area under the relevant runoff/recharge conditions that existed under pumping and nonpumping scenarios. For example, the runoff/recharge conditions that existed during the period that the suspected impact occurred would be quantified and entered into the model. The pumping that occurred at that time would also be entered. Results of this run would be compared to a run with the identical runoff/recharge conditions and no pumping. Evaluation of the results would include an analysis of the difference in water levels and/or spring flow in the area to determine if the change that is calculated by the model is sufficient to conclude a pumping related impact, given the assumptions and limitations of the model.\n1.3.1.3 (I.C.1.c.) Determining Degree of Significance Following a determination that there has been a measurable decrease in vegetation cover, and that the decrease or change was attributable to either groundwater pumping or surface water management practices, the following analysis shall be conducted to determine whether the measurable decrease or change is significant. Each of the following factors shall be evaluated and a determination made as to whether or not the impact is significant:\nThe size, location, and use of the area that has been affected.\nThe degree of the decrease, change or effect within the affected area.\nThe permanency of the decrease, change, or effect.\nWhether the decrease, change, or effect causes a violation of air quality standards.\nThe cumulative effect of the impact when judged in relation to all such areas of the Owens Valley.\nThe value of existing enhancement and mitigation projects addressing the environmental consequences of similar impacts.\nThe impact, if any, on rare or endangered species and on other vegetation of concern.\nWhether the decrease, change, or effect affects human health.\n1.3.1.4 (I.C.1.d.) Determining Significance of Other Effects on the Environment Any other impacts, including decreases in recreational opportunities and decreases in wildlife habitats, shall be examined by the Technical Group in a similar manner to the procedures set forth above or by other appropriate procedures to determine whether a significant effect on the environment has occurred that is attributable to groundwater pumping or changes in surface water management practices.\n1.3.2 (I.C.2.) Development and Implementation of a Mitigation Plan If it is established that there has been a significant decrease in live vegetation cover, or a significant amount of vegetation has changed from one vegetation classification to a lower classification, or any other significant effect on the environment has occurred, then any such significant impact will be mitigated as soon as a reasonable and feasible mitigation plan is developed. The Technical Group is responsible for developing a mitigation plan for the affected area, and the Department will commence implementation of the plan within 12 months after the significant impact has been established. A written mitigation plan will be prepared by the Technical Group and submitted to the Standing Committee during this 12 month period; however, the Technical Group is not precluded from implementing any necessary interim mitigation measures during this period.\n1.3.2.1 (I.C.2.a.) Mitigation plan goals In developing a mitigation plan, the Technical Group shall first establish a goal for the plan in conformance with the goals and principles of the Agreement. Thus, if there has been a significant decrease in live perennial vegetation cover or a change in a significant amount of vegetation from one classification to another, a primary goal of the plan would be to avoid causing further decreases or changes.\nGenerally, if there has been a significant decrease in vegetation live cover, the preferred goal of the plan would be to restore the same type of perennial vegetation cover in the affected area; and, if there has been a significant change in vegetation type, the preferred goal of the plan would be to restore vegetation to a vegetation community that falls within the type classification depicted on the vegetation management map. If any other significant effect on the environment occurs, the goal of the plan would be to reduce the impact to a level that is no longer significant.\nGenerally, compensatory mitigation (compensating for an impact to the environment by improving or enhancing an area located away from the affect area) would not be a preferred goal of a mitigation plan.\n1.3.2.2 (I.C.2.b.) Mitigation strategy In selecting the means of achieving the goals of the mitigation plan, the Technical Group will consider the feasible alternatives. When it is determined that the expertise of a consultant would be beneficial, such consulting services may be retained.\nAlternative means of achieving the mitigation goal that will be considered include: If the impact is attributable to groundwater pumping, cessation of groundwater pumping from wells that affect the impacted area would be the first consideration for mitigation. Also considered will be a change in the future management of groundwater pumping from the well to avoid F repetition of the impact.\nSurface water application to repair, rehabilitate, and/or restore the impacts will be considered as an alternative. Any water supply needed for the proposed mitigation shall be evaluated as to its potential for inducing further adverse environmental impacts.\nRevegetation of the affected environment shall be considered as an alternative. Generally, the preferred goal of revegetation would be to restore vegetation cover to the ecological viability which existed prior to the impact. A primary consideration in revegetation would be to use native species which grow in Owens Valley. Revegetation efforts will incorporate procedures to control weeds and fugitive dust. Full restoration may require a long period of time.\n1.3.2.3 (I.C.2.c.) Mitigation reporting/monitoring program As part of each mitigation plan, the Technical Group shall develop a reporting and monitoring program. At least once per year, the Technical Group shall report, in writing to the Standing Committee, on the effectiveness of the mitigation plan in achieving its goal.\nShould a mitigation plan fail to substantially achieve its goals, the Technical Group shall implement alternative, feasible mitigation, if any exists, that will achieve the goals. If no such alternative exists, a new mitigation goal will be developed and implemented for the afflicted area. The Technical Group shall report the change in writing to the Standing Committee, together with reasons for the change, and a new mitigation monitoring and reporting program will be adopted by the Technical Group.\n1.3.2.4 (I.C.2.d.) Forecasting impacts and avoidance If, through seasonal water balance calculations or through other means, the Technical Group projects that significant decreases or changes in vegetation could occur, the Technical Group will take such action as it deems feasible and necessary to avoid the projected impact. Such action would be in addition to the provisions for automatic well turn off."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Inyo County Water Departmemnt (ICWD) received Los Angeles Department of Water and Power’s (LADWP) report entitled “Revegetation Monitoring Report for Land Removed from Irrigation: Laws Parcels 090, 095,129, and Abandoned Land Parcel 094” in November, 2022.\nData supporting the report collected by LADWP in summer 2022 was received by ICWD staff in a digital excel file January 27th 2023. This data is evaluated here to verify data summaries in LADWP’s report and to provide feedback on the proposed timeline of the final two-year stage through 2024, when irrigation to the established plants is turned off to assess whether or not the stand can persist on valley-floor precipitation alone. The report informs that after irrigation support is removed for the 2023 and 2024 growing season, transects will be sampled again in 2024 to assess whether the 2003 revegetation plan goals are still satisfied.\n\n“If a parcel meets the goals after the two year rest, no further revegetation activities will be necessary and the parcel will be considered complete”.\n\nAfter examining the data provided to ICWD against the 2003 MND Revegetation Plan revegetation goals, LADWP’s reporting comports with ICWD’s independent data summaries in that cover goals and species richness was satisified in 2022. However, ICWD’s reading of the 2003 plan is that persistence without irrigation over two growing seasons is required before the project is considered complete.\nQuestions: - If irrigation ceased after the 2022 growing season, two years would be after the 2024 growing season not during the 2024 growing season. The most stressful period will be in August when soil moisture is at a low. In the spirit of the 2003 plan ICWD believes two years of late summer water stress after goals were initially met should be considered rather than just one late summer period of stress. Given the above average valley floor precipitation in 2022-23 winter, the water stress caused by the first year of no irrigation will be alleviated to some degree by soil moisture recharge from infiltrating precipitation. Surviving two or three drought years in a row would be a more legitimate test of sustainability compared to one wet year and just the beginning of the growing season in 2024.\nAnswers: LADWP indicated irrigation was possibly turnedd off July 1, 2022, which would give two years of no project activities by July 2024.\nCommon rabbitbrush, which is the dominant cover in LAW129/118, and big saltbush, which makes up a few percentage points in each parcel, may not fair well on precipitation alone as these species are typically associated with a groundwater in Owens Valley."

    "text": "Laws MND\n\n\nThere are three parcels in the Laws Ranch lease that were previously irrigated and will not be irrigated in the future under the plan for re-irrigation of the ranch. These parcels are Laws 90, 95 and 129. A portion of Laws 118 surrounds parcel 129. This area will be fenced and revegetation will be augmented, as needed, in conjunction with parcel 129. Laws parcel 94, which was mapped as abandoned agricultural land, will also be revegetated. These parcels are located northeast of the town of Laws and east of the Upper McNally Canal on the Laws 7.5’ USGS quad (Figure 1.) Under these plans, the parcels will be revegetated with the goal of restoring native vegetation that is similar in cover, and species composition to nearby sites. The prescribed conditions are to be established on each parcel by 2013, and must be present two years after established with no on-site revegetation activities. In preparing this plan, vegetation cover, composition, and species lists were determined by reviewing the LADWP 1984-87 vegetation inventory data for parcels in the vicinity (Appendix II) and located in the same ecological (range) site class in the Draft Benton-Owens Valley Soil Survey, hereafter referred to as the NRCS (Natural Resources Conservation Service 1994). In addition, species lists and other information from the NRCS descriptions were incorporated (Appendix I).\n\nRevegetation Plans for Lands Removed from Irrigation Laws Parcels 90, 95, 129 and Abandoned Agricultural Land Parcel 94. https://www.inyowater.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Laws-Neg-Dec-Reveg-plan-FINAL-3-17-03-copy.pdf\n\nThe revegetation goals for Laws parcels 90, 94, and 95 are the same. The goal is a native perennial vegetation cover of at least 10% by the year 2013 composed of at least ten different native species (including a native grass). Further, after two years with no on-site revegetation activities, monitoring must show that these goals have been sustained on each parcel. The overall cover value for these parcels is comparable to the cover measured during the LADWP vegetation inventory for adjacent undisturbed parcels inventoried in 1987, and is noted as the low-end cover value in the NRCS Soil Survey.-p2\n\n\nFor parcel 90, there should be at least three “hits” for at least six different native perennial species out of the total of all the readings of all the permanent transects in the parcel. The other four native perennial species should be observed as present on the parcel, but do not have to be “hit” on any transect. For parcels 94 and 95, there should be at least two “hits” for at least six different native perennial species out of the total of all the readings of all the permanent transects in the parcel. The other four native perennial species should be present on the parcel, but do not have to be “hit” on any transect. For parcel 129/118, there should be at least two “hits” for at least five different native perennial species out of the total of all the readings of all the permanent transects in the parcels. The other three native perennial species should be present on the parcel, but do not have to be “hit” on any transect."

    "text": "Inyo County Water Departmemnt (ICWD) received Los Angeles Department of Water and Power’s (LADWP) report entitled “Revegetation Monitoring Report for Land Removed from Irrigation: Laws Parcels 090, 095,129, and Abandoned Land Parcel 094” in November, 2022.\nData supporting the report collected by LADWP in summer 2022 was received by ICWD staff in a digital excel file January 27th 2023. This data is evaluated here to verify data summaries in LADWP’s report and to provide feedback on the proposed timeline of the final two-year stage through 2024, when irrigation to the established plants is turned off to assess whether or not the stand can persist on valley-floor precipitation alone. The report informs that after irrigation support is removed for the 2023 and 2024 growing season, transects will be sampled again in 2024 to assess whether the 2003 revegetation plan goals are still satisfied.\n\n“If a parcel meets the goals after the two year rest, no further revegetation activities will be necessary and the parcel will be considered complete”.\n\nAfter examining the data provided to ICWD against the 2003 MND Revegetation Plan revegetation goals, LADWP’s reporting comports with ICWD’s independent data summaries in that cover goals and species richness was satisified in 2022. However, ICWD’s reading of the 2003 plan is that persistence without irrigation over two growing seasons is required before the project is considered complete. If irrigation ceased after the 2022 growing season, two years would be after the 2024 growing season not during the 2024 growing season. The most stressful period will be in August when soil moisture is at a low. In the spirit of the 2003 plan ICWD believes two years of late summer water stress after goals were initially met should be considered rather than just one late summer period of stress. Given the above average valley floor precipitation in 2022-23 winter, the water stress caused by the first year of no irrigation will be alleviated to some degree by soil moisture recharge from infiltrating precipitation. Surviving two or three drought years in a row would be a more legitimate test of sustainability compared to one wet year and just the beginning of the growing season in 2024.\nLikely common rabbitbrush, which is the dominant cover in LAW129/118, and big saltbush, which makes up a few percentage points in each parcel, will not fair well on precipitation alone as these specie are typically associated with a groundwater in Owens Valley."

    "text": "2.1 Green Book Box I.C.1.a.ii\nTRANSECTS FOR MONITORING VEGETATION RESPONSE TO PUMPING\nVegetation transects are included within the Green Book to serve two purposes: 1) to estimate transpiration from a monitoring site, and 2) for use in determining whether vegetation has decreased or changed significantly from the previous cover.\n\nDetailed measurements of leaf area index shall be made at each of the monitoring sites using the techniques described in Section III.C. These measurements will be used to estimate evapotranspiration from the vegetation at the monitoring site for comparison to available soil water and, ultimately, to project plant-soil water balance and the need for water table recovery. Vegetation transects shall also be used in cases of suspected vegetation changes due to groundwater pumping. However, rather than using the intensive sampling technique of Section III.D for calculating evapotranspiration, plant cover shall be measured by the line-point technique described below.\nDuring the 1984-87 inventory, most parcels were sampled with line-point transects of 100 feet in length, with sampling points at one-foot intervals, providing a two-dimensional representation of vegetation within the parcel. At each one-foot marker, the first contact with the uppermost layer of live plant cover was recorded. Cover and species composition were calculated from all sampling points along the transect.\n\nThe 1984-87 inventory shall be used as a “baseline” to determine whether vegetation cover and/or species composition has changed. This inventory is the only one of sufficient accuracy to permit comparison of species composition and cover.\nA subset of the vegetation parcels mapped during the 1984-87 baseline inventory shall be annually monitored to accommodate statistical comparison with data collected during the baseline inventory. Such monitoring may rely on repeat measurement of georeferenced locations using the line-point-intercept method to track live cover and species composition over time. The baseline inventory was summarized at the parcel scale, thus for statistical comparison, transect locations derived from a set of random locations and azimuths provide a valid statistical comparison.\nParcels to be monitored were initially selected based on meeting one or more of the following criteria: (1) parcel contained a permanent monitoring site; (2) baseline inventory data were collected for the parcel; (3) parcel was in close proximity to a pumping well; (4) information of past and current land use for parcel was available; (5) parcel was representative of one of the groundwater-dependent plant communities originally mapped during the baseline inventory; (6) soil characterization was available for the parcel; (7) characterization of the landscape position was available for the parcel. In 2015, Inyo County and Los Angeles began a joint monitoring program utilizing a combination of parcels and transects evaluated and agreed upon by the staffs of both parties. As of 2016, 1,688 transects across 141 parcels are jointly monitored by both parties.\nApproximately 100 of the 141 parcels monitored in 2016 will be jointly selected and monitored each year by Inyo County and Los Angeles. Prior to the field season, staff from both parties will determine which parcels of the 141 will be monitored. Existing permanent transects will be used for those parcels selected unless the staffs of both parties agree that a change in transect location is justified and necessary. Transects will be evenly split between ICWD and LADWP. Either party may independently conduct monitoring of additional parcels or transects; however, any data so collected shall be provided to the other party.\nThe field protocol and calibration for field observations for the joint line-point monitoring program largely follows Herrick et al.(2016). At the onset of the monitoring season, staff from both parties shall meet in the field to discuss methods and to calibrate all field personnel. In summary the field protocol is as follows:\n\nnavigate to the transect start point with a handheld GPS device;\nverify presence of an aluminum tag which has been previously attached to a nearby object (i.e. shrub, debris, etc.);\nuse a photo taken from the previous year to precisely locate the transect start point and to examine the accuracy of the azimuth used during the previous year;\nif the start point on the photo is off by more than 6 meters from the point indicated by a GPS reading, or a start point cannot be positively identified, a start point will be placed at the point indicated by the GPS device;\nif the designated transect azimuth is off by more than ±5 degrees from the azimuth depicted within the previous year’s transect photo, the designated transect azimuth will be used. If not, the azimuth depicted within the previous year’s photo will be upheld;\nstretch a tape measure to the direction of the pre-established azimuth;\nfor each transect, notes shall be taken on whether an aluminum tag is present, and whether or not the current year’s start point and compass azimuth matches those depicted within the previous year’s transect photo;\nrecord species identity at each half meter starting at 0.5 m and ending at 50 m yielding 100 possible hits;\nplace a dry erase board with the parcel name, transect number, azimuth and date at the base on the transect line and take a picture from the start point toward the end point that captures the entire transect.\n\nAll live cover is tallied for each species for each transect. Data are exchanged at the end of the field season after each party digitally enters and proofs field data.\nThe field technique and sampling design may be modified to permit detailed statistical comparison if deemed necessary in the future. Statistical analysis will be used to determine the measurability (statistical significance) of vegetation changes from the 1984-87 baseline inventory maps. Such an analysis may include, but is not limited to, Welch’s test (t-test with unequal variance), Wilcox test (Mann-Whitney test), Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Generalized Linear Model (GLM) for vegetation cover and permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance (PERMANOVA) and Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) for vegetation composition. For parcels with small baseline inventory sample sizes (e.g. 1-4 transects), a one-sample t-test may be performed using the baseline inventory sample mean as the null hypothesis for the test. Determination of measurability will be made by the Technical Group on case by case basis in accordance with Water Agreement IV.B and Green Book Section I.C.\nBox I.C.1.a.ii shall be modified as necessary in the future to incorporate new or modified field techniques, technology, and/or analytical methods. Such changes will be jointly developed by the staffs from both Inyo County and Los Angeles and will be presented to the Technical Group for consideration."
