<p>The purpose of this report is to provide the Inyo-LA Technical Group with a summary of the annual monitoring program described in <a href="https://www.inyowater.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/GBMemo_SCfeb2017.pdf">Green Book Box I.C.1.a.ii</a> <em>Transects for monitoring vegetation response to pumping</em> - specifically this report flags groundwater-dependent vegetation parcels in wellfield areas that show measurably different vegetation characteristics in the current year when compared to the 1984-87 vegetation baseline. This list is further subset by those parcels that have been below baseline for five years or more. Because this automated report ingests only the field data from the line point monitoring program, the summary statistics from this report can be reviewed in late summer as soon as the field data has been digitally entered.</p>

<p>-<a href="https://www.inyowater.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/GBMemo_SCfeb2017.pdf">Green Book Box I.C.1.a.ii</a> <em>Transects for monitoring vegetation response to pumping</em> was revised by the Technical Group and Inyo/LA Standing Committee in 2017 to reflect settlement on how to combine the vegetation monitoring programs that both Inyo County Water Department (1991-2015) and Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (2004-2015) had managed separately up until 2015. ICWD and LADWP began a jointly implemented monitoring program with inter-agency calibration training, and data sharing agreements in 2015 and, in 2017, the Inyo/LA Standing Committee approved the Green Book update that described these monitoring activities and identified statistical procedures to determine a measurable vegetation change from baseline conditions. - Inyo/LA Long Term Water Agreement (<a href="https://www.inyowater.org/documents/governing-documents/water-agreement/">LTWA</a>) - LTWA Technical Appendix (<a href="https://www.inyowater.org/documents/governing-documents/green-book/">Green Book</a>)</p>
</div></div><p>The statistical methods described in Green Book Box I.C.1.a.ii have been translated into a data pipeline written in the R computing language - so that the implementation of the procedures are transparent and reproducible.</p>
<p>The parcels flagged in this report based on the interannual comparisons to baseline are intended to be evaluated against the NDVI time series to verify/corroborate any significant trends over certain periods of time or between two years. The remote sensing evaluation includes satellite scenes through mid September, so the remote sensing comparison can be conducted in October after the full growing season data is in, hence the decoupling of the two evaluations in separate reports.</p>
<p>The full water year hydrological data transfer from LADWP is provided in December-January and includes data through the previous Oct 1 - so the monitoring well depth-to-water hydrographs and pumping can then be evaluated for each parcel that is determined to be measurably different from baseline with respect to line point data in this report and the <a href="https://zach-nelson.github.io/open-science-notebook/posts/ndvi-stats/">NDVI comparison</a>.

<span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Background</h2>
<p>Pertinent sections in Green Book I.C.1 <em>Determination of Significant Impacts</em> is included below for background.</p>
<p><strong>Green Book Section I.C</strong> <em>Impact Determination and Mitigation</em></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Among the primary goals of the Agreement are to manage groundwater pumping and surface water management practices as follows: 1) to avoid causing significant decreases in live vegetation cover; 2) to avoid changing a significant amount of vegetation from one classification to a lower (alphabetically) classification; 3) to avoid causing other significant effects on the environment; and 4) in a manner consistent with State and Federal laws pertaining to rare and endangered species. If any of these goals are not achieved, feasible mitigation of the affected area will be implemented. However, mitigation is not considered a primary management tool, but rather a secondary tool that will be employed should impacts occur that are inconsistent with the goals of the Agreement.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“This section outlines a procedure for determining whether decreases and/or changes in vegetation or other significant effects on the environment have occurred or are occurring in a given management area. It describes the process the Technical Group will follow to ascertain whether a change is significant, and thus, whether it requires mitigation. It also describes how the Technical Group will develop and implement a mitigation plan and monitoring and reporting program.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Section I.C.1</strong> <em>Determination of Significant Impacts</em></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“A significant decrease or change or other significant effect on the environment will be mitigated if it is measurable, attributable to groundwater pumping or surface water management practices, and significant. The Agreement provides that the determination of significance of an impact, and thus, whether it must be mitigated, will be made on a case by case basis. The steps in the case by case analysis are described below.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Section I.C.1.a</strong> <em>Determining Measurability</em></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In determining whether a change in vegetation cover or composition is measurable, the Technical Group will consider all relevant factors, including:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>comparison of current vegetation cover and composition in the affected area with similar data taken during other time periods, including the 1984-87 vegetation inventory data;</p></li>
<li><p>Comparison of vegetation cover and composition at the affected area with vegetation data from one or more control sites located in areas which have similar vegetation, soil, and precipitation conditions;</p></li>
<li><p>comparison of the ratio of recently deceased vegetation to live vegetation in the affected area with other areas not affected by pumping and with similar vegetation cover and composition, soil, and precipitation conditions;</p></li>
<li><p>use of air photo and remote sensing techniques to assist in making comparisons of conditions during different time periods and in mapping the affected area;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>comparison of data from randomly selected transects with similar data taken during other time periods, including the 1984-87 vegetation inventory data. This method will be employed in areas where monitoring site data does not exist, or where data covers an insufficient time period. Such transects will be performed as described in Box I.C.1.a.ii.</strong>”</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In reference to these ‘relevant factors’ listed above, Section I.C.1 explains:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“A determination of measurability will be made if <em>any</em> of the relevant factors considered indicate even a <em>small</em> documentable change in vegetation cover or composition has occurred.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.inyowater.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/GBMemo_SCfeb2017.pdf"><strong>TRANSECTS FOR MONITORING VEGETATION RESPONSE TO PUMPING</strong></a></p>
<p>Vegetation transects are included within the Green Book to serve two purposes: 1) to estimate transpiration from a monitoring site, and 2) for use in determining whether vegetation has decreased or changed significantly from the previous cover.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Detailed measurements of leaf area index shall be made at each of the monitoring sites using the techniques described in Section III.C. These measurements will be used to estimate evapotranspiration from the vegetation at the monitoring site for comparison to available soil water and, ultimately, to project plant-soil water balance and the need for water table recovery. Vegetation transects shall also be used in cases of suspected vegetation changes due to groundwater pumping. However, rather than using the intensive sampling technique of Section III.D for calculating evapotranspiration, plant cover shall be measured by the line-point technique described below.</p></li>
<li><p>During the 1984-87 inventory, most parcels were sampled with line-point transects of 100 feet in length, with sampling points at one-foot intervals, providing a two-dimensional representation of vegetation within the parcel. At each one-foot marker, the first contact with the uppermost layer of live plant cover was recorded. Cover and species composition were calculated from all sampling points along the transect.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The 1984-87 inventory shall be used as a “baseline” to determine whether vegetation cover and/or species composition has changed. This inventory is the only one of sufficient accuracy to permit comparison of species composition and cover.</p>
<p>A subset of the vegetation parcels mapped during the 1984-87 baseline inventory shall be annually monitored to accommodate statistical comparison with data collected during the baseline inventory. Such monitoring may rely on repeat measurement of georeferenced locations using the line-point-intercept method to track live cover and species composition over time. The baseline inventory was summarized at the parcel scale, thus for statistical comparison, transect locations derived from a set of random locations and azimuths provide a valid statistical comparison.</p>
<p>Parcels to be monitored were initially selected based on meeting one or more of the following criteria: (1) parcel contained a permanent monitoring site; (2) baseline inventory data were collected for the parcel; (3) parcel was in close proximity to a pumping well; (4) information of past and current land use for parcel was available; (5) parcel was representative of one of the groundwater-dependent plant communities originally mapped during the baseline inventory; (6) soil characterization was available for the parcel; (7) characterization of the landscape position was available for the parcel. In 2015, Inyo County and Los Angeles began a joint monitoring program utilizing a combination of parcels and transects evaluated and agreed upon by the staffs of both parties. As of 2016, 1,688 transects across 141 parcels are jointly monitored by both parties.</p>
<p>Approximately 100 of the 141 parcels monitored in 2016 will be jointly selected and monitored each year by Inyo County and Los Angeles. Prior to the field season, staff from both parties will determine which parcels of the 141 will be monitored. Existing permanent transects will be used for those parcels selected unless the staffs of both parties agree that a change in transect location is justified and necessary. Transects will be evenly split between ICWD and LADWP. Either party may independently conduct monitoring of additional parcels or transects; however, any data so collected shall be provided to the other party.</p>
<p>The field protocol and calibration for field observations for the joint line-point monitoring program largely follows Herrick et al.(2016). At the onset of the monitoring season, staff from both parties shall meet in the field to discuss methods and to calibrate all field personnel. In summary the field protocol is as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>navigate to the transect start point with a handheld GPS device;</li>
<li>verify presence of an aluminum tag which has been previously attached to a nearby object (i.e.&nbsp;shrub, debris, etc.);</li>
<li>use a photo taken from the previous year to precisely locate the transect start point and to examine the accuracy of the azimuth used during the previous year;</li>
<li>if the start point on the photo is off by more than 6 meters from the point indicated by a GPS reading, or a start point cannot be positively identified, a start point will be placed at the point indicated by the GPS device;</li>
<li>if the designated transect azimuth is off by more than ±5 degrees from the azimuth depicted within the previous year’s transect photo, the designated transect azimuth will be used. If not, the azimuth depicted within the previous year’s photo will be upheld;</li>
<li>stretch a tape measure to the direction of the pre-established azimuth;</li>
<li>for each transect, notes shall be taken on whether an aluminum tag is present, and whether or not the current year’s start point and compass azimuth matches those depicted within the previous year’s transect photo;</li>
<li>record species identity at each half meter starting at 0.5 m and ending at 50 m yielding 100 possible hits;</li>
<li>place a dry erase board with the parcel name, transect number, azimuth and date at the base on the transect line and take a picture from the start point toward the end point that captures the entire transect.</li>
</ol>
<p>All live cover is tallied for each species for each transect. Data are exchanged at the end of the field season after each party digitally enters and proofs field data.</p>
<p>The field technique and sampling design may be modified to permit detailed statistical comparison if deemed necessary in the future. Statistical analysis will be used to determine the measurability (statistical significance) of vegetation changes from the 1984-87 baseline inventory maps. Such an analysis may include, but is not limited to, Welch’s test (t-test with unequal variance), Wilcox test (Mann-Whitney test), Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Generalized Linear Model (GLM) for vegetation cover and permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance (PERMANOVA) and Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) for vegetation composition. For parcels with small baseline inventory sample sizes (e.g.&nbsp;1-4 transects), a one-sample t-test may be performed using the baseline inventory sample mean as the null hypothesis for the test. Determination of measurability will be made by the Technical Group on case by case basis in accordance with Water Agreement IV.B and Green Book Section I.C.</p>
<p>Box I.C.1.a.ii shall be modified as necessary in the future to incorporate new or modified field techniques, technology, and/or analytical methods. Such changes will be jointly developed by the staffs from both Inyo County and Los Angeles and will be presented to the Technical Group for consideration.</p>

<p>From September 1984 to Nov 1987, LADWP inventoried and mapped vegetation on LA-owned lands in Owens Valley into 2126 polygons of similar vegetation type (223,168 acres). The Green Book vegetation monitoring program focuses on a subset of these groundwater-dependent parcels (Green Book types B, C, D and some E) that are affected by groundwater pumping within the unconfined shallow aquifer when pumping causes water table and it’s capillary fringe to decline below the reach of obligate groundwater-dependent species within Owens Valley.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Monitoring Sample Size</h2>
<p>Parcels were initially selected based on meeting one or more of the following criteria: (1) the parcel contained a permanent monitoring site where soil/vegetation water balance is calculated; (2) baseline data was collected for the parcel; (3) the parcel was in close proximity to a pumping well; (4) information of past and current land use for the parcel was available. The number of parcels sampled has varied over the years in response to staffing availability but has ranged from 30-150 with a total number of parcels sampled at least one year after baseline at 192.</p>
<p>Most parcels were sampled in 1984-1987 using line-point-intercept sampling. Some parcels were not directly sampled but rather assigned cover and composition values from parcels with similar vegetation conditions. Welch’s t-test for unequal variance was used to evaluate in which parcels and in which year(s) total perennial cover and perennial grass cover has significantly differed from baseline. Since the sample standard deviation is used to construct 95% confidence interval, this method can be used for parcels in which baseline data contained more than one transect or nonzero sample variance. Where unmeasured parcels during baseline subsequently inherited a single baseline value from nearby parcels, a one-sample t-test is used to determine significance from baseline. For parcels with low baseline sample sizes, procedures in Green Book Box I.C.1.a.ii were followed: “For parcels with small baseline inventory sample sizes (e.g.&nbsp;1-4 transects), a one-sample t-test may be performed using the baseline inventory sample mean as the null hypothesis for the test”.</p>

<p>The number of parcels sampled each year as well as the number of transects sampled per parcel has varied due to fluctuations in annual staffing. Thus, some parcels have varying numbers of transects sampled across time. Other parcels have not been sampled continuously during the entire monitoring period. In 2022, 136 were sampled.</p>
<p>Perennial species cover is considered in this report, because annual species are not dependent on groundwater. Perennial cover was further aggregated into grass, non-gramminoid herbaceous (herb), and shrub. In order to analyze the changes in the composition of total perennial cover, the proportion of shrub, herb and grass cover as a fraction of total perennial cover was calculated. Transect data are summarized for each parcel and year using the arithmetic average, creating a history of cover over time for each parcel.</p>

<p>For an overview of the pumping effect on GDEs in Owens Valley, parcels were classified in the early 1990s as either within a wellfield group potentially affected by pumping or a control group where the pumping effect was determined to be negligible on water table drawdown. In the 2000s, a rarefied subset of these parcels that had been sampled every year since 1992 was selected and this set has continued to be sampled each year to 2022. This particular set is small with 13 control and 31 wellfield parcels. For this rarefied subset, averages are plotted below for comparison of the groups over time and linear trends are reported for total cover, perennial herbaceous cover and woody shrub cover separately. In 2022, 4341 control and 9193 wellfield parcels were sampled. Thus this rarefied set is limited to 34% of wellfield parcels and 32% of control parcels in the current year sample.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">2.6</span> Control Wellfield Designation</h2>
<p>Parcels were classified as either belonging to a wellfield group or control group based on criteria derived from groundwater drawdown during the period of maximum pumping rate that occurred between 1987 and 1993. Parcels were assigned to the wellfield group if (1) kriged DTW estimates exceeded 1-m water-table drawdown during 1987-1993 or (2) they were located at sites corresponding to modeled drawdown contours greater than 10 ft. Parcels were assigned to the control group if (1) kriged DTW estimates were less than 1 m and (2) they were located at sites corresponding to modeled drawdown contours less than 10 ft. If the kriged DTW estimates were not reliable owing an inadequate test-well network near the vegetation parcel, then the groundwater-flow model estimate of the 10-ft drawdown contour was used as the sole criteria to designate parcels as either wellfield or control.</p>
<p>An exception to the above criteria was applied to parcels associated with drawdown contours greater than 10-ft yet located near a surface water source (specifically, a canal, sewer pond, creek, river, or a ground water seepage source) that would lessen local drawdown effects—these parcels were classified as control.</p>
<p>Some parcels currently in the wellfield group have higher water tables than during the 1987 to 1993 period, but remain in the wellfield group because of their close proximity to pumping wells and potential for pumping-induced drawdown. Each parcel is also classified by its Green Book management type, Holland plant community type and by its status as either wellfield or control.</p>

<p>In the 2022 growing season, ICWD and LADWP collectively measured 1667 vegetation transects over 136 vegetation parcels (43 control parcels and 93 wellfield parcels). The control and wellfield parcel groups, rarefied to only those parcels that have been measured every year from 1992 to 2022, are compared in <a href="#fig-plot-wellcontrol">Figure&nbsp;2</a>. Linear trend over the 30-year timeseries is computed in <a href="#fig-plot-wellcontrol-trends">Figure&nbsp;3</a>. Comparison of group means between only two time periods (e.g.&nbsp;1986 vs 2022) using boxplots and paired t-tests are presented in <a href="#fig-box-plot-wc-yoy-compare">Figure&nbsp;4</a> for year over year comparisons (e.g.&nbsp;2022 vs 2021), 2015 drought year vs 2022 in <a href="#fig-box-plot-2015-cyear">Figure&nbsp;5</a>, 1994 vs 2022 <a href="#fig-box-plot-94-cYear">Figure&nbsp;6</a>, baseline vs 1992 in <a href="#fig-box-plot-86-92">Figure&nbsp;7</a>, baseline vs 2022 in <a href="#fig-box-plot-bl-cyear">Figure&nbsp;8</a>, and 2017 wet year vs 2022 in <a href="#fig-box-plot-2017-cyear">Figure&nbsp;9</a>.</p>
<p>At the wellfield scale we have a four-panel map showing the parcels sampled with line point in 2022 color coded by perennial cover and grass cover on the left and by the change from baseline cover values on the right (e.g.&nbsp;for Laws <a href="#fig-lw-map">Figure&nbsp;10</a>). Where parcels are below baseline with regard to total perennial cover or the total perennial grass component, the parcel is bordered in red and included in the table following the map (e.g.&nbsp;for Laws <a href="#tbl-datatable-lw">Table&nbsp;2</a>)<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>

<p>The methods outlined in this report automatically flagged wellfield parcels in <a href="#tbl-datatable-chronic">Table&nbsp;1</a> that have been statistically below baseline for past 5 consecutive years with respect to total perennial cover or with respect to perennial grass cover. In the individual wellfield sections, all parcels below baseline 2022 are tabulated ( <a href="#tbl-datatable-lw">Table&nbsp;2</a>, <a href="#tbl-datatable-bp">Table&nbsp;3</a>,<a href="#tbl-datatable-ta">Table&nbsp;4</a>, <a href="#tbl-datatable-ts">Table&nbsp;5</a>, <a href="#tbl-datatable-io">Table&nbsp;6</a>, <a href="#tbl-datatable-ss">Table&nbsp;7</a>, <a href="#tbl-datatable-bg">Table&nbsp;8</a>). For the parcels listed in <a href="#tbl-datatable-chronic">Table&nbsp;1</a>, the measurability of the effect has been determined to a reasonable degree (no recovery to baseline in the last five years including the last wet year) following Green Book Section I.C.1.a (BOX I.C.I.a.ii.a).</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>use of air photo and remote sensing techniques to assist in making comparisons of conditions during different time periods and in mapping the affected area;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Though not part of an adopted Green Book procedure, NDVI time series allows for comparisons of the line point data to an independent proxy of vegetation cover - conveniently spanning the baseline period to the present when including all Landsat satellites 5, 7, 8 and now 9. The correlation between NDVI summarized between July 15-Sep 15 is fairly well predictive of field-sampled perennial cover over the summer June-August 2022.</p>

<li id="fn3"><p>Where they do not, potentially suggests an outlier - and could be attributed to various sources of error in the estimation of the sample mean including inter-annual sample bias associated with re-randomizing transects each year with respect to the 1991-2014 period; and for the baseline data, whether or not the baseline and field resampling time series are proportionally correlated with the ndvi time series. Because the NDVI timeseries is spatially complete over the parcel and more temporally dense in the number of satellite scenes compared to field visits, it is more stable in that different periods may be more comparable when contrasted with the line point sampling.<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
