# Open Science Notebook

An [Open Science Notebook](https://zach-nelson.github.io/open-science-notebook/) as shared as a research website to distribute data products and answer questions for Inyo Water Department Staff.

I created this repository to make it easy and fast to share data analyses with coworkers at the Inyo County Water Department, to make it easy on my future self to remember what I've done, and in general to promote some key practices leading to reproducible research, and open science. Those include:

-   an Interactive development environment ([Rstudio IDE](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/))
-   reproducible analysis ([targets R package](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/))
-   reproducible and parameterized reports ([Quarto](https://quarto.org/))
-   quick and easy sharing of results through ([Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)) and
-   collaboration through the Github ([Version Control](https://happygitwithr.com/index.html)) system.

This is public github repository which allows the free hosting of this website on the github pages web hosting platform - associated with every github repository.

Posts, or notebook entries will be limited to just code, analytics, visualizations, summaries and models, informational 'metadata' on new data set updates, tutorials on commonly asked questions relating to data queries, GIS, statistical and process-based models. Most of these posts will be derived from a targets pipeline and a quarto document. One hope is that they may be generally useful in the future as the frequently-asked-questions (FAQs) type of posts build in number.

The html format opens up the realm of interactive tables and figures and maps, and dispenses with the necessity of worrying about typesetting (i.e. figures floating to the wrong sections, tables cut in half etc). Most importantly, the code and data live with this html output, as in *if the data changes the html document is dynamically updated*- but only if specified to do so.

The posts are organized on the github pages website for this repository ([zach-nelson.github.io/open-science-notebook/](https://zach-nelson.github.io/open-science-notebook/)). Since it has a blog structure, the dates from the posts are sorted chronologically and they can be filtered by keywords that were associated with the post.
